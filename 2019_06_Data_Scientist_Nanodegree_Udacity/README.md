## Part 1: Introduction
## Part 2: Supervised Learning
### Lesson Summary
Linear Regression
Linear regression is a very effective algorithm to predict
numerical data.
Perceptron Algorithm
The perceptron algorithm is an algorithm for classifying data.
It is the building block of neural networks.
Decision Trees
Decision trees are a structure for decision-making where each
decision leads to a set of consequences or additional decisions.
Naive Bayes
Naive Bayesian Algorithms are powerful tools for creating
classifiers for incoming labeled data.
Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines are very effective models used for
classification.
Ensemble Methods
Bagging and boosting are two common ensemble methods for
improving the accuracy of supervised learning approaches.
Supervised Learning Assessment
Test your Supervised Learning concepts with a quick
assessment.
## Part 3: Unsupervised Learning
## Part 4: Big Data & Map Reduce
## Project: Explore and Summarize Data
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets or find one of your own and perform a complete exploratory data
analysis on the data using R.
